I am fairly new to tech so I am in no ways an expert on anything. I just like to share what I'm learning and help others learn too. I don't see a point in keeping helpful or useful knowledge to yourself. Be a mentor.

I always appreciate when I find a robust yet clear tutorial wether I am trying to solve a problem or just reading for curiosity. I try to replicate that same balance with the content I provide. Let's be honest, no one has endless time for research, especially when you need a quick answer. There are two categories that my content falls into: **Problem Solving** and **Explorative Writing**

###### Problem Solving
This content is based on issues that I have run into. If I find a solution to something that was problematic, I will share the solution as well as the troubleshooting steps that were used to arrive at the solution.

##### Explorative Writing
This content is based on what I am learning. When I explore various topics, I find that writing about them helps me retain information effectively. While this will be tech-focused, it will lean more towards theoretical and research writing rather than technical writing like in problem solving.
