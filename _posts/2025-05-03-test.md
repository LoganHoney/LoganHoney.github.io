## How did I get here?
This is a test of writing in **_markdown_**. So far, It doesn't seem to be that bad and writing inside of this framework is way easier than what I was doing before. The only this that I am unsure of is how to write blocks of code within **_markdown_**. Let me do some googling quick...

## My findings
So it looks pretty simple. Let's give this a shot
#### SQL
<div style = "background-color: #FFFFFF">
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Example
WHERE This_is_awesome = 'TRUE'
```
</div> 

### Python
```python
print("Hello World")
```
### Conclusion
I have been writing in this for a total of about 5 minutes. I am curious to see how the final project looks as this was way easier than copy and pasting templates. My next challenge will be seeing how to change the text color.
