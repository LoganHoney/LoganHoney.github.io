## What are relational databases?
From healthcare to fast food, the supply chain to your local coffe shop, data is instrumental in providing the insights needed to succesfully manage any insitution. Let's take a look at a few qualities that give relational databases their power.

### Structured Storage
Not only do relational databases store vast amounts of data, data is also stored efficiently. Relational databases use tables to organize data into rows and columns. This structured format allows for:

- **Clear Relationships**: Data can be easily related through foreign keys, enabling complex queries across multiple tables.
- **Data Integrity**: Constraints (like primary keys and foreign keys) ensure that the data remains accurate and consistent.

#### Clear Relationships
All data in these databases are connected or **_related_**. How this is done is through the aforementioned **_foreign keys_**. A foreign key can be defined as a field that exsists in more than one table. This alows all of the data in both tables to be tied together. This is the driving force between a relational database's power. I believe that an example would be of benefit:

##### Customer Table

| **C_ID** | First_Name | Last_Name | Street | City | State | Zip |
| :---- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 01 | Wallace | Cleaver | 211 Pine St | Mayfield | OH | 12345 |
| 02 | Michael | Scott | 473 Apple Ln | Scranton | PA | 16754 |
| 03 | Ray | Barone | 647 Robin Dr | New York | NY | 21257 |

##### Orders Table

| Order_ID | **C_ID** | Item | Color | Quantity | Unit Price |
| :--------| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1457 | 03 | Desk Chair | Black | 1 | $250 |
| 1458 | 01 | Fountain Pens | Blue | 5 | $1 |
| 1459 | 02 | Coffee Mug | White | 2 | $10 |


By linking these tables through Customer_ID, it becomes clear which customer placed each order. This facilitates quick transactions and ensures that customers receive the products they ordered. Consider the potential applications; this concept extends beyond just customers and orders.

-**Health Insurance:** It can track which claims have been submitted by an individual.
-**Entertainment:** It can be used to identify what movies have been purchased through an individuals Netflix account.
-**Inventory Management:** It can be  used with a barcode system and monitor the quantity of products on the shelves and determine when it needs to be restocked.
-**Education:** It can associate students with their course enrollments and grades, helping to track academic progress.

Here is an example of structure using a small database:

#### Data Integrity

Data integrity is maintained through the use of primary keys. These keys are typically system-generated rather than user-defined, as they must be unique to prevent duplication. Each piece of information in a table is linked to a primary key. For instance, consider the Driver License Number and Social Security Number; both of these identifiers must be unique, and various data points are associated with them.

Hereâ€™s an example of a table that illustrates this concept: 

| DL Number | First_Name | Last_Name | DOB | Height | Gender | Address |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| D500-000-000 | John | Doe | 05/13/1995 | 5'10" | M | 123 Maple Dr. |

The driver license number is the primary key because it is unique and cannot be duplicated. In contrast, there could be multiple individuals with the name of John Doe, lots of people could have been born on 05/13/1995, or a whole family of drivers could be living at 123 Maple St. The point is, each row in a table must have a unique identifier to maintain data integrity.
