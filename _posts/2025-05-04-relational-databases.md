## What are relational databases?
From healthcare to fast food, the supply chain to your local coffe shop, data is instrumental in providing the insights needed to succesfully manage any insitution. Let's take a look at a few reasons for their power.

- **Data Integrity**: Constraints (like primary keys and foreign keys) ensure that the data remains accurate and consistent.
